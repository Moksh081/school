## 💡 Overview

**MySchool** is a fully responsive and easy-to-use school website designed during the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. With education systems disrupted and government schools lacking proper digital infrastructure, this project aims to bridge the digital divide by offering a simple yet effective platform for schools to communicate, share updates, and integrate with tools like Google Classroom and Meet.

This was my **first full-stack web project**, created to support my school digitally and represent its achievements, classes, departments, and resources in an organized format.
